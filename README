SSH Docker Image
*************************

This demo is aimed to demonstrate the use of running a Docker container
that can accept ssh connections. 



Dockerfile
--------
In the dockerfile, we need to install ssh-server, and run 
service ssh start
so that the /run/sshd directory will be created. 

We also create a new user, since we don't want to run the container as root.
BUT - in order to start sshd, we do need root priviliges, so it needs to be 
sudoer.

We define the CMD as ["sudo", "/usr/sbin/sshd", "-D"]

Running the container 
--------------------
We can just run the container with -it, which will then prompt us for
password for develop user. 

Another option:
Run the container with the `cat` command so it won't exit
Then, run docker exec sudo /usr/sbin/sshd
